| **12:21** | Due to the instabilities from Monte, Ampion is appointed CEO for the current time. |
| **12:19** | <span class="red">LATEST:</span> Monte seems to be unreachable following multiple contact attempts. One call in particular, however, did not cut off due to bandwidth limits, but rather due to a deliberate declining of the call. This means that there is a person at the other end of the call, and either translates to Monte still being alive or having been assassinated or kidnapped. |

| **11:38** | It is now uncertain where Monte currently is or if he is still alive after, according to Monte, being lost in the woods for about 12 hours following a parachute failure causing him to land in an unknown location, presumably within China looking from the flight path of where Monte jumped off from. |
